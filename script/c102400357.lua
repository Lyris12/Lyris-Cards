During your opponent's turn, if a monster is attacking (Quick Effect): You can banish this card from your hand; Special Summon 1 "Lightsworn" monster from your GY or banishment in Attack Position (its effects are negated), then change the attack target to it and proceed to damage calculation. If a monster that was Special Summoned by this card's effect is sent to the GY or banished (Quick Effect): You can return this banished card to the GY; excavate the top 3 cards of your deck, then either send those cards to the GY or banish them. You can only use each effect of "Kuribohsworn" once per turn.
