	--Activate up to 3 of these effects (you cannot activate the same effect twice, and you resolve them in the listed order, skipping any that were not chosen); ● Special Summon from your Deck, 1 monster with the same current name, or original name, as a face-up monster on the field. ● Target 1 face-up monster on the field; choose 1 other monster on the field, and the name of either monster becomes the name of the other. ● Choose 1 face-up monster on the field. It can be treated as a Tuner if used as Synchro Material this turn. Then, unless you activated all 3 of the above effects, you can apply this effect. ● Immediately after this effect resolves, Synchro Summon 1 Synchro Monster, using monsters on either field, but all with the same name. You can only activate 1 "Elegant Iceflower Tuning" per turn.
